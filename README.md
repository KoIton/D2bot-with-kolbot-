I would say overall Kolbot is one of the best bots, I did not create this bot I am just sharing this with you as it is the best bot I have ever used.
I am not responsible if you get banned for botting but it is highly unlikely you will get banned for it as I have used it for many years. I am also not the creator of kolbot
So I take no Credit for making it.
